# Elements and Compounds

## Augmented Reality Project
● In this project, we will apply the Augmented Reality (AR) technology, which has gained high popularity recently.\
• We need to use Augmented Reality Kit designed for developers. (Vuforia)\
• WE need Unity Game Engine for using these kits. So, you have to download and install Unity to OUR computer. \
• Our projects must be based on Unity and contain Augmented Reality technology.\
● Augmented Reality Kit- Vuforia (Windows, macOS)

## Augmented Reality Project Development Tools
● Unity version 2017.4.1\
● Vuforia 7 (Augmented Reality Tool)\
● Android Studio - Development tool for Unity projects on Android-based devices (needed when you use Android)

## Minimum requirements
● Single Login Page which include open and exit project buttons, etc.\
● When we click open button, our programs should open the main screen which should include Augmented Reality qualifications.\
● Our programs should be designed with Unity Game Engine.\
● Our projects should be useful for Health, Education or Game, etc.\
● When we finish your projects, we can improve it so as to work on IOS and Android devices. (Preferably) 



## Abstract

In this Augmented Reality project, an application was developed to support education by using Vuforia in the Unity engine. The elements are taught at a young age and can be difficult to remember because they cannot be seen. In order to solve this problem, we can see these elements in the real world by using Vuforia and square codes in our project. 

## Description Of The Project

Aim:  The aim of this project is to see the elements in the real world.

Tool: This project is based on Unity3D Engine, Vuforia, and Assets.
The operation can be performed on any machine that can run Unity. But to run Vuforia for iOS iPhone 6s or more, for Android Android 7.0 or more.

Google Drive is used to store and develop and share our project with group members.
Unity3D Engine used to create a 3D game.
Vuforia used to create AR experiences that interact with objects and the environment.
Assets used for shaders.

## Description Of The Project

Step by step solution will be explained with headlines

## Image Targets (Vuforia Engine)

Firstly, Target was needed to transfer our objects to the real world. We placed our atoms on the QR codes. We created a Vuforia Engine database and used them.

## Rotate Around Script
Elements have electrons. Electrons move around the nucleus. They are called orbits and they have size and energy. We create rotateArround script to implement that moves. It can move when we declare speed, element position and way.

## Merge Script
We need to combine two or more elements to form compounds. To do this, we set the minimum distance. Elements stick together when they are shorter than this range.When they make this move, the electrons and atomic explanation also disappear.

## Shaders
We covered the surfaces of our atoms with shaders from the Unity Asset Store.

## Information Labels
We put labels on atoms containing their information.

## Scenes
## Menu

In the menu scene, there is a start button to “Start” and a “Quit” button to exit the application. Elements Square Code button opens Google Drive file with QR codes. On the left are the currently used elements.On the right side, how to use the application is explained. We have background video in the menu scene.

## Mainscreen

The Mainscreen scene is where we do everything. As a navigation, the forward button directs us to the exit screen from the application. The back button helps us to go to the Menu screen. We have background sound in that scene.

## Quit

In the quit scene, there is a “Quit” button to exit the application.
